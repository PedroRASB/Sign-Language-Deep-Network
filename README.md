# Sign-Language-Deep-Network
Deep convolutional feedforward network trained on the Sign Language MNIST.
Network that I trained (.h5), with 97.4% test accuracy, disponible at "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cMc4Nl1Y93fsphDi1QNQY0_scoM-FRlv".
Dataset disponible at "https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist".
Network_Very_Large_Training trains a deep feedforward convolutional network on the dataset, saves the network and computes the training error.
Action_Network_v2 loads the saved network, select one random test image and classifies it.
